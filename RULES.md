## JS Standard Style

Proper indentation is required, so having `prettify` with the default settings is enough.<br>

**important notes :**<br>
**_No heavily coded functions inside the render method._** <br>
**_Unused dependencies and/or variables are Not welcomed._** <br>

- Make sure that your component is properly sized and to divide it into smaller parts. We advise you to start small.

- Test the cases where props are `empty` or `undefined`.
