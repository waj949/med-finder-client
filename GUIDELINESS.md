## Naming convention

###### Components

The name should be in _lowerCamelCase_ as it's used for the class or/and the function in that component.<br>

For a component with multiple children, all of the files related to that component will be merged inside one folder for convenience.<br>

###### Services

The name should follow this pattern: <br>

`{{name of the component that uses this service /* the one that uses it the most in case of multiple components */}} + Services`
